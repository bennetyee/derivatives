# derivatives

This repository contains a PyQt5 based program to aid in visualizing
taking limits in obtaining the derivative of a function.

The program `visualize.py` puts up two graphs, one for f(x) and the
other for f'(x) over a range x0 to x1.  The function f and the range
boundaries x0 and x1 are command-line arguments.  Beneath the two
graphs are sliders, one for x and the other for Δx, where Δx is used
in the numerical derivative f'(x).
